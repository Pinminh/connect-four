This project is regarded as an assignment from [The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-connect-four/project_submissions).

## What is Connect Four
Connect Four is a classic strategy game in which 2 players go head-to-head in a battle to own the grid!. The game's rule is explained concisely at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylZBRUJi3UQ). For more technical details, you can find it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).

## Purposes
This project is my first project using the practices of TDD (Test Driven Development) where tests are first written to determine the implementations of functional units. I found it really difficult at first since it required that we must think of the structures of the program clearly in order to lay out valid tests. But once I get over that state, everything seems a little bit faster to think and write.
